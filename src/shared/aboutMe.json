  "title": "About me",
  "body": "After years spent in marketing and sales, I decided to follow my own vocation and become a web developer. It wasn’t easy at the beginning: a promising career behind me and a deep cliff to jump in front of me. What was on the other side of it? What I’ve always wanted to do: building cool web sites, apps, platforms and softwares to make people’s lives easier. I knew what I was about to leave and had no idea about what I was going to deal with. Anyway, I believe you can’t ignore your instinct, that’s why I just… jumped. That jump was made of thousands of hours studying cutting edge technologies and languages to do my job in the best way possible, tough moments where I felt lost and hundreds of rejections. Hard but precious times: they made me the professional I’m today and, as a Programmer Analyst and Scrum Master, I can tell you I would do again every single thing that led me to write this paragraph."
